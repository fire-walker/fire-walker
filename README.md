# Here's a list of cool things I've pieced together
At least I think they're cool.



### [Anime Tracker](https://github.com/fire-walker/anime-tracker)
A site built around the anilist API. If you track your anime using anilist. Just enter your usename and this site would show off your lists with a simplistic elegance. For reference visit my profile [here](https://anime.thelonelylands.com/?user=blekmus)

### [Birthday Tracker](https://github.com/fire-walker/birthday-tracker)
Site I built as a replacement for [genesis](https://github.com/fire-walker/Bots/tree/master/genesis). As a serverless solution to track the birth dates of people close to me.

### [Unix Rice Dot Files](https://github.com/fire-walker/rice)
As the name suggests. This here is my main desktop configuration. All dot files needed to recreate the desktop environment I current have, live here. Both the [starpage](https://github.com/fire-walker/startpage) and [protonmail themes](https://github.com/fire-walker/protonmail-themes) are made complementary to these color schemes and configurations.

### [Proton Mail Themes](https://github.com/fire-walker/protonmail-themes)
Custom css themes I made for my favourite email service. 

### [Browser Startpage](https://github.com/fire-walker/startpage)
A fresh dad joke everytime you start your browser. Who wouldn't want that. See it in action [here](https://fire-walker.github.io/startpage/). If you're interested in making this your startpage, just paste the aforementioned url in your browser startpage settings.

### [Discord Bots](https://github.com/fire-walker/bots)
This may not be that relevant, cos these were basically made to satisfy selfish needs. But I made em so, whatever.
